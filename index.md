- DSC 180 A04: Causal Copilot (Biwei Huang)

# Prompts
1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
    - The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is using an open source knowledge extractor called OneKE to extract relational knowledge from textual sources and feeding that data to another agent, Causal Copilot, to facilitate causal discovery and causal inference.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
    - Using the topic described above, take financial papers such as earnings call transcripts or financial news outlets to establish a digestable knowledge graph and causal relation graph. 

3. **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
    - Our current goal for this quarter is to understand and use the tools that we have been given. Having a clear and working pipeline of what we aim to produce would be a good goal to work towards instead.
    - `Text → OneKE → Triple Relation Extraction (Subject, Relation, Object) → Knowledge Graph → Causal Copilot → Causal Discovery`

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
    - Web scraping would be a great technique to incorporate into our project to automatically collect new financial text data for extraction and causal analysis.
